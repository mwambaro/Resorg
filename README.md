# Research Resources Organization (Resorg) App

Research can be time and resource consuming. You do not want your research results to be lost since you will need them next time you come across difficulties. You must be able to achieve the goal of organizing, accessing, displaying, storing, and restoring those research results that mean the world to you. It must be noted that this is not just another media library or media storage application. It reflects the way you organize knowledge in your mind, so tidy and neat that the knowledge pieces become available any time you need them. Think of it as your mind with the bonus of sensible solution to memory loss, forgetfulness, and orderliness mind problems.
